# Distribution plots:

          add = "mean", rug = TRUE)
# This density plot suggest that CVD affects older patients

# Using a different method, let's see the CVD and WEIGHT distribution in this dataset.
# First, calculate the mean of each group: 
library(plyr)                                     # This method uses plyr and ggplot2
mu <- ddply(cleandf_sample, "CVD", summarise, grp.mean=mean(weight))

          # Results:
          #      CVD    grp.mean
          # 1   CVD         77
          # 2   healthy     72
# Create density plot.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cleandf_sample, aes(x=weight, color=CVD)) +
  geom_density()
# Add mean lines
p<-ggplot(cleandf_sample, aes(x=weight, color=CVD)) +
  geom_density()+
  geom_vline(data=mu, aes(xintercept=grp.mean, color=CVD),
             linetype="dashed")
p
# This density plot suggest that patients with CVD tend to weigh more than healthy patients.



# Normality tests:

# Shapiro normality test for WEIGHT:
library(nortest)
# This test rejects the hypothesis of normality when the p-value is â‰¤ 0.05.
# First we need to prepare our sample by converting our objects from character to numeric:
cleandf_sample$weight <- as.numeric(as.character(cleandf_sample$weight))     
# The Shapiro normality test caps at 5000 observations so let's make a smaller sample.
weight_sample <- sample_n(cleandf_sample, 5000)
shapiro.test(weight_sample$weight)               # Shapiro test
          # Result:
          # W = 1, p-value < 0.0000000000000002
# The p-value from Shapiro test suggests REJECTING the null hypothesis. 



# Since our data is so large, let's also try the Anderson Darling normality test to see if 
# there's a difference.
ad.test(cleandf_sample$weight)
          #Results
          # A = 654, p-value < 0.0000000000000002
# This test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being 
# tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free.
# The p-value from Anderson test suggests REJECTING the null hypothesis.

# The p-value represented in both the Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling test falls below 0.05.
# The null hypothesis is REJECTED suggesting a NON-NORMALLY distributed population.



# Homogeneity of variance:

# Our data is non-normal so we will be using the Levene test. Levene's test is used to assess 
# the equality of variances for a variable calculated for two or more groups.

# First, let's set our numeric vectors: 
group <- cleandf_sample$CVD
y <- cleandf_sample$weight
# Now let's do our test.
library(car)                            # This test requires the car package
leveneTest(y, group, location=c("median", "mean", "trim.mean"), trim.alpha=0.25,
            bootstrap = FALSE, num.bootstrap=1000, kruskal.test=FALSE, 
            correction.method=c("none","correction.factor","zero.removal","zero.correction"))
          # Results (center = median: c("median", "mean", "trim.mean"))
          #         Df   F value              Pr(>F)    
          #group     1     426                <0.0000000000000002 ***
          #        69998

# The Levene test is used to assess the equality of variances for a variable calculated 
# for two or more groups asses the null hypothesis that the population variances are equal. 
# Since the resulting p-value of Levene's test is less than 0.05 significance level, 
# the obtained differences in sample variances are unlikely to have occurred based on random 
# sampling from a population with equal variances. 

# Thus, the null hypothesis of equal variances is rejected and it is concluded that there is 
# a difference between the variances in the population.


# One way ANOVA test:
# We have two groups to compare: CVD and healthy patients

# Comparing BMI of CVD and healthy patients: 
group_by(cleandf_sample, CVD) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(BMI, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
          # Results:
          #   CVD     count    mean       sd
          #  <chr>    <int>   <dbl>      <dbl>
          #  CVD      34979    28.6      6.38
          # healthy   35021    26.5      5.61

# This ANOVA test shows that, while there are more healthy patients in this database,
# the mean and standard deviation (SD) are higher for CVD patients. This suggest that CVD 
# patients are more likely to have higher BMIs. 

# Comparing age of CVD and healthy patients:
group_by(cleandf_sample, CVD) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
          # Results:
          #   CVD     count    mean       sd
          #  <chr>    <int>   <dbl>      <dbl>
          #  CVD      34979    54.9      6.35
          # healthy   35021    51.7      6.79
# This result suggests that cardiovascular disease is more like to affect older patients.



# Visuals: Box plot, bar graph

CVD_count = cleandf_sample %>% filter(CVD == "CVD")   # Filtering CVD patients

# Box plots showing the shape of the distribution, central value, and variability.
